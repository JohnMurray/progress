# Progress

This is just a simple utility application that I am building for myself. I constantly
find myself with too many tasks at work that have (far) too many steps to call it
_completed_ to really keep track of. Task/ToDo lists get long and unmanageable, Jira
tracks all that stuff (mostly) but I have no insight into it so getting the context
needed (to do anything useful) is difficult. Also, I'm a very visual person and the
current set of tools I have don't offer much in that regard. So, this is a simple
utility (not attached to a particular piece of task/project-management software)
that helps me visualize the progress of all my tasks.

Possibly the answer would be to multi-task less, set a proper WIP-limit, etc. However
that's not always in my control, so this will have to do for now. If you would like
to deploy your own application, you can do so as detailed below:
